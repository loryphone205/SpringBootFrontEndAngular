  <h1>What does it mean to be a Programmer?</h1>
  <p>
    I honestly don't know myself, I just know that I enjoy coding and playing
    the Piano.
  </p>
  <p>I Hope that someday, someone will see my works, even if they suck.</p>
  <p>I have nothing to lose anymore.</p>
  <h1>I have sacrificied my Piano Skills to pursue this.</h1>
  <h1>I'm sorry, Armanda.</h1>
  <p>I'm sorry that I left you, but you know the reason...</p>
  <p>The music has died.</p>
